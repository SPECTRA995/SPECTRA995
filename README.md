## :boy: About me :

### I have been studying Front-end direction for about a year. Looking for a chance to start working as a Front-end developer, because this is my main goal! :pray:

### I know that there are people with more knowledge than me and I think this is quite normal. Everyone has their own life and their own opportunities to achieve certain goals. I know for sure that I am ready and able to learn, including from my mistakes. I like to learn something new and interesting! :wink:
